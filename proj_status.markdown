**Project Requirements and Status**

 <span style="color:blue">Study overview</span>

The objective of the tACS initiative is twofold: 
1. To identify a basic tACS paradigm that could be widely agreed upon in terms of theoretical efficacy;
2. To conduct experiments using this paradigm across multiple research centres and investigate whether the application of tACS yields robust and replicable outcomes. 

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
By collaborating across different sites, with complementary expertise, we aimed to increase the likelihood of obtaining conclusive findings through a multi-centre approach.
In essence, our goal is to evaluate the consistency of results between centres and obtain a representative estimate of the effect size of tACS, specifically in the domain of visual perception.

Participation in the tACS challenge is open to single researchers, research groups and labs. If you would like to join us, write us an email to [tacschallenge@gmail.com](mailto:tacschallenge@gmail.com)


 <span style="color:blue">Requirements for data acquisition</span>
Meet the minimum criteria in equipment settings for tACS challenge:

1. <u>Transcranial electric stimulator device:</u> minimum stimulation intensity 2 mA (peak-to-peak amplitude), that can produce an alternating current at 10Hz, with 1 channel or more.

2. <u>Stimulus presentation device</u>: a software controlled, Arduino-based visual stimulation device box that will control 5 + 1 LEDs. The custom-built Arduino set-up is currently being estimated to cost about 700-800 â‚¬ per device (design or devices available by Nir Grossman). Since the device is being designed with robustness in mind, it will be possible to share a device across multiple labs.

For a general estimate of costs see the table below*

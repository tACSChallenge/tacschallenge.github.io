<h2>Project Requirements and Status</h2>
</header>

 <span style="color:blue"><b>Study overview</b></span>

The objective of the tACS initiative is twofold: 
1. To identify a basic tACS paradigm that could be widely agreed upon in terms of theoretical efficacy; <span style="color:green"><b>[COMPLETED]</b></span>
2. To conduct experiments using this paradigm across multiple research centres and investigate whether the application of tACS yields robust and replicable outcomes. 

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
By collaborating across different sites, with complementary expertise, we aimed to increase the likelihood of obtaining conclusive findings through a multi-centre approach.
In essence, our goal is to evaluate the consistency of results between centres and obtain a representative estimate of the effect size of tACS, specifically in the domain of visual perception. 

<span style="color:blue"><b>Data acquisition requirements</b></span>

Commitment to:
1. Collect data for <b>20 young healthy participants (18 - 39 years old, excluding drop-outs)</b>
2. Provide a report on the stimulation and acquisition procedures following the tACS Challenge SOPs
3. Share raw data and meta-files in the tACS challenge open repository

We are hoping to achieve the largest tACS study conducted to date, >30 labs, contributing data for 20 participants each = more than 600 participants!


 <span style="color:blue"><b>Equipment requirements</b></span>

Meet the minimum criteria in equipment settings to join the tACS challenge:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
1. <u>Transcranial electric stimulator device:</u> minimum stimulation intensity 2 mA (peak-to-peak amplitude), that can produce an alternating current at 10Hz, with 1 channel or more.

2. <u>Stimulus presentation device</u>: a software controlled, Arduino-based visual stimulation device box that will control 5 + 1 LEDs. The custom-built Arduino set-up is currently being estimated to cost about 700-800 € per device (design or devices available by Nir Grossman). *The tACS Challenge core team has 5 devices (atm) that can be shared across labs if collaborating labs don’t want to or cannot pay for having a device made.*


3. <u>Consumables and sundries</u>: these include caps, electrodes, gel, etc.

|Current switching device<sup><b>2</b></sup> |optional| |
|EMLA cream |optional| |


<sup><b>1</b></sup> Where manufacturers are listed these are just examples. We do not make specific manufacturer recommendations.

<sup><b>2</b></sup> The current switching device allows switching between montages (i.e. different stimulation conditions). It was developed to allow for more efficient switching between the 3 montages used in the study. This is optional as the montage switching can be done manually. Details for the current switching device and associated costs can be provided upon request.

 <span style="color:blue"><b>Additional data acquisition - optional</b></span>

Participating labs can record EEG data as part of this study on their own initiative: Sampling rate 1000 Hz, High-pass filter: DC recording or < 0.1 Hz, Low-pass filter > 100 Hz; Channels up to 32 passive or active placed according to the 10-20 International EEG system.

 <span style="color:blue"><b>Authorship</b></span>

Those providing substantial contributions to the project (e.g., data collection) as co-authors, core team as corresponding authors, author list reflects degree of involvement.

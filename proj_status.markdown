<h2>Project Requirements and Status</h2>
</header>

 <span style="color:blue"><b>Study overview</b></span>

The objective of the tACS initiative is twofold:
1. To identify a basic tACS paradigm that could be widely agreed upon in terms of theoretical efficacy; <span style="color:green"><b>[COMPLETED]</b></span>
2. To conduct experiments using this paradigm across multiple research centres and investigate whether the application of tACS yields robust and replicable outcomes.

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
By collaborating across different sites, with complementary expertise, we aimed to increase the likelihood of obtaining conclusive findings through a multi-centre approach.
In essence, our goal is to evaluate the consistency of results between centres and obtain a representative estimate of the effect size of tACS, specifically in the domain of visual perception.

<span style="color:blue"><b>Data acquisition requirements</b></span>

Commitment to:
1. Collect data for <b>20 young healthy participants (18 - 39 years old, excluding drop-outs)</b>
2. Provide a report on the stimulation and acquisition procedures following the tACS Challenge SOPs
3. Share raw data and meta-files in the tACS challenge open repository

We are hoping to achieve the largest tACS study conducted to date, >30 labs, contributing data for 20 participants each = more than 600 participants!


 <span style="color:blue"><b>Equipment requirements</b></span>

Meet the minimum criteria in equipment settings to join the tACS challenge:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
1. <u>Transcranial electric stimulator device:</u> minimum stimulation intensity 2 mA (peak-to-peak amplitude), that can produce an alternating current at 10Hz, with 1 channel or more.

2. <u>Stimulus presentation device</u>: a software controlled, Arduino-based visual stimulation device box that will control 5 + 1 LEDs. The custom-built Arduino set-up is currently being estimated to cost about 700-800 € per device ( devices available from [here](https://jonathanh13.wixsite.com/bluemagnet){:target="_blank"}). *The tACS Challenge core team has 5 devices (atm) that can be shared across labs if collaborating labs don’t want to or cannot pay for having a device made.*



3. <u>Consumables and sundries</u>: these include caps, electrodes, gel, etc.

|Current switching device<sup><b>2</b></sup> |optional| [available here](https://jonathanh13.wixsite.com/bluemagnet/tacs-switching-module){:target="_blank"}|
|EMLA cream |optional| |


<sup><b>1</b></sup> Where manufacturers are listed these are just examples. We do not make specific manufacturer recommendations.

<sup><b>2</b></sup> The current switching device allows switching between montages (i.e. different stimulation conditions). It was developed to allow for more efficient switching between the 3 montages used in the study. This is optional as the montage switching can be done manually. Details for the current switching device and associated costs can be provided upon request.

 <span style="color:blue"><b>Additional data acquisition - EEG resting state</b></span>

EEG data acquisition was included in the protocol during the review of the Registered Report.

Resting state EEG will be recorded from the same electrode pair that is used to record the
tACS signal. Two electrodes at POz and Cz will be connected to a **conventional
EEG amplifier** using Cz as a reference and FPz as Ground. The EEG will be sampled at a
minimum of 100 Hz, during 2 minutes eyes-open and 2 minutes eyes-closed resting state.
These resting state EEG data will be recorded before the start of the experiment, and after the experiment.

Note: the tACS device will not be suitable to collect EEG data

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
The transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) Challenge presents a platform for the international non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) community to engage in a collaborative cross-border endeavour. Its primary objective is to rigorously examine the real-time impact of tACS on behaviour. 

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
Our goal is to establish whether tACS-induced cortical stimulation is effective in rhythmically modulating visual performance in humans.

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
To achieve this we have developed an experimental design to disambiguate between tACS phasic modulation of neural activity in the visual cortex and sensorial factors that might be considered confounds, such as retinal or somatosensory co-stimulation. 

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
The project aims to promote the quality of NIBS research through a commitment to methodological rigour, acquisition of large datasets, scientific transparency, and data sharing.

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
The protocol and resources currently available have been developed by the **[tACS Challenge Core Team](/coreteam/)**
